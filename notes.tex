\section*{Notes:}
\subsection{ the empirical problem/question posed  }
\begin{itemize}
\item how good are the benefits and the cost of debt financing in explaining the debt ratio.
\item how good are the benefits and the cost of debt financing in explaining the debt ratio converting to the target debt ration.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{ the model(s) under consideration/ the relations between the variables suggested by economic theory  }
\begin{itemize}
\item the target debt ratio $MDR^*_{it}$ can be modeled by $MDR^*_{it} = x`_{it} \beta + \eta_{it}$ 
\item with $x'_it$ consisting out of the following variables
\item $ebit_{it}$  earnings before intererst payments and texes, divided by total assets, 
\item	$mb$ ratio of market value to book value of assets 
 \item $deo_ta$ deoreciation expenses as a proportion of fixed assets 
\item $\log (ta) $ log of total assets 
\item $fa_ta$ proportion of fixed assets
\item $rd_ta$ research and development expenditures, divided by total assets (0 if missing)
\item $rd_dum$ dummy indicating whether $rd_ta$ is missing
\item $indmedian$ industry median debt ratio
\item $rated$ dummy indicating whether the firm ha a prublic debt rating
\end{itemize}
\subsection{ the formal model }
\begin{itemize}
\item partial-adjustment model
\item Costs that arise from adapting the debt ration $MDR_{it}$ to the target debt ratio $MDR*_{it}$ 
cause a slower adjustment, with the adjustment speed coefficient $\gamma$
\item the real adjustments of the firms debt ration are therefore just $\lb 1 - \gamma \rb $ times the adjustment that would be perfect 
without adjustment costs
\item $MDR_{it} - MDR_{i,t-1} = (1-\gamma) \lb MDR^*_{it} - MDR_{i,t-1} \rb$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{ the data (source, coverage, proxies for the variables in the theoretical model)  }
\begin{itemize}
\item sample of fitms Compustat Industrial Annual Tapes, time years 1987 to 2001 exclude financial firms with special factors
\item final sample subsample N = 3777 firms, 19573 firm year observations
\item industry median proxy for industry characteristics that are not captured by the other explanatory variables
\end{itemize}
\subsection{ the estimation method(s), empirical specification of the model, comparison of models  }
\begin{itemize}
\item OLS 
\item within estimator
\item first difference estimator
\item Anderson-Hsiao instrumental variable estimator
\item Arellano-Bond GMM estimator
\end{itemize}
\subsection{ results/conclusions  }
\begin{itemize}
\item This slow adjustment is consistent with the hypothesis that other considerations outweigh the cost of deviation from optimal leverage.
\item none of the reported estimates for the dynamic model to explain firms debt ratios is entirely convincing
\end{itemize}
